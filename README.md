# JavaBankUnimi

JavaBank is an application that allows you to manage a bank account with the possibility of making deposits, withdrawals and transfers to other registered users.
All transactions are saved and can be viewed at any time.

Users are stored in a mysql online database. Passwords are encrypted using a hash function with an addition of a salt to avoid saving identical passwords in the same way and to avoid dictionary attacks.
